### Introduction:

​			It is important to improve the productivity of the software developers. Organizations have a range of choices to help their software developers become their most successful version, from changing office layouts, investing in new resources, to cleaning up the source code. Yet which choices have the greatest impact? This is big question for the organization how to increase the productivity Organizations such as require empirical advice on which variables to seek to exploit to increase efficiency in the best possible way. In a perfect world, they should invest in a number of factors that increase profitability, but time and resources are limited so we need to invest selectively. The aim is to understand the factors influencing the efficiency of software developers in comparison. 

### Methodology:

​			It is a qualitative study conducted data through interview. To accomplish the main goal of this study, they conceived a survey consisting of a set of productivity problems, a set of productivity factors, and a set of demographic variables. In a survey 622 developers across 3 companies asked about these productivity factors and self-assessed productivity. 

### Results:

​			The findings indicate developers are comparable in some respects to software workers, and differ in others from them. For example, job enthusiasm was the best predictor of productivity for developers, but that indicator predicted productivity for analysts to almost the same degree. Their results indicate that the factors most strongly correlating with self-rated efficiency were non-technical factors, such as work enthusiasm, social encouragement for new ideas and valuable input on job results. The results of this study also show that self-rated productivity of software developers is more closely linked to the variety of tasks and the ability to work remotely relative to other knowledge workers.
