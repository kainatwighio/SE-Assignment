### Introduction:

​			Agile software development accepts improvements to requirements even close to the deadline, "Welcoming changing demands, even late in development" as one of its principles. This is one of the main rule of agile which make him different from traditional way. It is not so easy for the organization to work like that they have to face many problems. However, it is argued that reacting to and embracing change requires not just addressing strategic problems but also coping with emotional factors, which is easier said than done. Although agile practices may provide a structure for managing change, the human aspects of reacting to change are still not understood. That is why this study worked on emotional level of the employees. 

​			Emotions serve as motivators of action and have a relation with cognition, efficiency, and decision making. Emotion studies are becoming more and more centered in software engineering. Nevertheless, emotions of agile teams have not been studied in response to changes in requirements, leading to the question, "how do agile teams react emotionally to changes in requirements (RCs)? This is the main aim objective of this study. Therefore it is very interesting to research how they react to these changes emotionally.

### Methodology:

​			In this study, they (i) implement a novel hybrid method by using Grounded Theory and Sentiment Analysis,(ii) present three distinct stages by emotional responses, a description of emotions, and differences in emotional and sentimental polarity at each stage,(iii) highlight the need for agile teams to take emotional responses into account when applying agile concepts and practices to tackle change. They collected the data from participants in a manner were asked to fill out a pre-interview questionnaire to gather details about the demographics, project, and team. The interviews were then conducted face-to- face from 7 participants and online from 3 participants. Each interview lasted on average about 50-60 minutes. For data analysis a mixed approach was taken to evaluate the qualitative data obtained in three phases.

### Results:

​			Using a novel hybrid method of grounded theory and sentiment analysis, they identified three phases of change in requirements (RC), where participants documented agile teams that responded emotionally: receiving, implementing, and delivering an RC. The findings of this pilot study show that while agile is based on accepting change, agile teams are going through emotional ups and downs in reacting to changes in requirements. Hence it is important to consider emotional dimensions to understand and develop how agile teams react to changes in action.
