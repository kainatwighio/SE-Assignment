### Introduction:

​			When understanding of human dimensions of software increases, software that accounts for its principles is increasingly demanding by the public. Failure to account for human values in software ( e.g., equality and fairness) can result in user dissatisfaction and negative socioeconomic effects. It can result in adverse socio-economic impacts such as financial loss and damage to reputations. This study argues that work and practice in software engineering is actually paying inadequate attention to certain human values. It may be due to the lack of sufficient technological and methodological support for the software engineering principles. To provide evidence for this argument, they have reviewed research papers on software engineering (SE) as part of their broader approach to the analysis of human values to determine how much consideration the SE sector has paid to values.

### Methodology: 

They listed publications from top-tier SE conferences and journals manually based on their importance to different values. This was focused on multiple raters manually classifying the paper abstracts. Classification based on abstracts is sub-optimal, instead of reading the entire article, but finds a correlation between the quality and the time required for the study. All papers had several raters, and Fleiss' Kappa was used to calculate inter-rater cooperation.

They have chosen to list papers from the last four years of conferences and journals that are widely regarded as top SE venues, namely, the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), the ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE), the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE), and the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM). The pilot and the main analysis all used SVS as the scheme for classification. Totally there were seven rates in which 5male and 2female were employed with different levels of SE relevant work experience, varying from doctoral students to professors, including one rater from outside the field of software engineering.

### Results:

In this paper, they explored the existence of a wider spectrum of human values in software engineering research involving trust, equality and social justice. Using Schwartz Values Structure as their classification system, 1350 newly published papers (2015–2018) were categorized into top-tier SE conferences and journals. They conclude that the human ideals are regarded by only a small proportion of SE studies. Although safety as a value category and privacy as a particular value stand out as the key focus in SE study, few other human values are considered, such as Helpful, Environmental Protection and Social Justice.
